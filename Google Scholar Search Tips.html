            <p>Get the most out of Google Scholar with some helpful tips on searches, email alerts, citation export, and more.</p>
<p><b>Finding recent papers</b></p>
<p>Your search results are normally sorted by relevance, not by date. To find newer articles, try the following options in the left sidebar:</p>
<ol>
<li>click "Since Year" to show only recently published papers, sorted by relevance;</li>
<li>click "Sort by date" to show just the new additions, sorted by date;</li>
<li>click the envelope icon to have new results periodically delivered by email.</li>
</ol>
<p><b>Locating the full text of an article</b></p>
<p>Abstracts are freely available for most of the articles. Alas, reading the entire article may require a subscription. Here're a few things to try:</p>
<ol>
<li>click a library link, e.g., "FindIt@Harvard", to the right of the search result;</li>
<li>click a link labeled [PDF] to the right of the search result;</li>
<li>click "All versions" under the search result and check out the alternative sources;</li>
<li>click "Related articles" or "Cited by" under the search result to explore similar articles.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you're affiliated with a university, but don't see links such as "FindIt@Harvard", please check with your local library about the best way to access their online subscriptions. You may need to do search from a computer on campus, or to configure your browser to use a library proxy.</p>
<p><b>Getting better answers</b></p>
<ul>
<li><p>If you're new to the subject, it may be helpful to pick up the terminology from secondary sources. E.g., a Wikipedia article for "overweight" might suggest a Scholar search for "pediatric hyperalimentation".</p></li>
<li><p>If the search results are too specific for your needs, check out what they're citing in their "References" sections. Referenced works are often more general in nature.</p></li>
<li><p>Similarly, if the search results are too basic for you, click "Cited by" to see newer papers that referenced them. These newer papers will often be more specific.</p></li>
<li><p>Explore! There's rarely a single answer to a research question. Click "Related articles" or "Cited by" to see closely related work, or search for author's name and see what else they have written.</p></li>
</ul>

            <p>Access links cover a wide variety of ways in which articles may be available to you - articles that your library subscribes to, open access articles, free-to-read articles from publishers, preprints, articles in repositories, etc.</p>
            <p>When you are on a campus network, access links automatically include your library subscriptions and direct you to subscribed versions of articles. On-campus access links cover subscriptions from primary publishers as well as aggregators.</p>
            <p><b>Off-campus access</b></p>
            <p>Off-campus access links let you take your library subscriptions with you when you are at home or traveling. You can read subscribed articles when you are off-campus just as easily as when you are on-campus. Off-campus access links work by recording your subscriptions when you visit Scholar while on-campus, and looking up the recorded subscriptions later when you are off-campus.</p>
            <p>We use the recorded subscriptions to provide you with the same subscribed access links as you see on campus. We also indicate your subscription access to participating publishers so that they can allow you to read the full-text of these articles without logging in or using a proxy. The recorded subscription information expires after 30 days and is automatically deleted.</p>
            <p>In addition to Google Scholar search results, off-campus access links can also appear on articles from publishers participating in the off-campus subscription access program. Look for links labeled [PDF] or [HTML] on the right hand side of article pages.</p>

            <p>You can disable off-campus access links on the <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_settings#3">Scholar settings page</a>. Disabling off-campus access links will turn off recording of your library subscriptions. It will also turn off indicating subscription access to participating publishers. Once off-campus access links are disabled, you may need to identify and configure an alternate mechanism (e.g., an institutional proxy or VPN) to access your library subscriptions while off-campus.</p>

                <p>That said, Google Scholar is primarily a search of academic papers. Shorter articles, such as book reviews, news sections, editorials, announcements and letters, may or may not be included. Untitled documents and documents without authors are usually not included. Website URLs that aren't available to our search robots or to the majority of web users are, obviously, not included either. Nor do we include websites that require you to sign up for an account, install a browser plugin, watch four colorful ads, and turn around three times and say coo-coo before you can read the listing of titles scanned at 10 DPI... You get the idea, we cover academic papers from sensible websites.</p>

                <p>These are articles which other scholarly articles have referred to, but which we haven't found online. To exclude them from your search results, uncheck the "include citations" box on the left sidebar.</p>

                <p>First, click on links labeled [PDF] or [HTML] to the right of the search result's title. Also, check out the "All versions" link at the bottom of the search result.</p>
              
            
              

              
                <p>Second, if you're affiliated with a university, using a computer on campus will often let you access your library's online subscriptions. Look for links labeled with your library's name to the right of the search result's title. Also, see if there's a link to the full text on the publisher's page with the abstract.</p>
              
            
              

              
                <p>Keep in mind that final published versions are often only available to subscribers, and that some articles are not available online at all. Good luck!</p>

                <p>Not even close. That phrase is our acknowledgement that much of scholarly research involves building on what others have already discovered. It's taken from Sir Isaac Newton's famous quote, "If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants."</p>
